## üìå Project Overview

**Objective**: Build a binary classification model to predict whether a loan applicant will be approved (1) or rejected (0) based on financial and demographic features.

**Key Components**:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- ANN architecture design with TensorFlow/Keras
- Hyperparameter tuning and regularization
- Model evaluation and interpretability

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values and outliers
  - Categorical encoding (One-Hot, Label Encoding)
  - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
  - Class imbalance handling (SMOTE)

- **ANN Model**:
  - Customizable hidden layers
  - Dropout regularization
  - Batch normalization
  - Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling

- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC curves
  - Confusion matrix analysis
  - Feature importance visualization
